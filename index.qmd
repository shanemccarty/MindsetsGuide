# Prologue {.unnumbered}

Welcome to **Know Your Mindsets: An Interactive Guide** for PH 322 — Communicating Health Information in the Digital Age at Binghamton University. This course is part of the [public health minor](https://www.binghamton.edu/decker/public-health/academics/minor.html), which is offered by Decker College's Division of Public Health.

## About the Course

*Where did you get that information? Can I trust them? How do I know they're not lying to me?* We navigate questions like these every day --- when reading the news, scrolling social media, or deciding whether to follow a doctor's advice. **PH 322 — Communicating Health Information in the Digital Age** explores these real-world challenges by introducing the theories, strategies, and tools used to design and evaluate health messages across media platforms. Through hands-on projects and critical analysis, you will learn how to create messages that are accurate, persuasive, culturally relevant, and ethically grounded --- while also learning how to recognize misinformation and manipulation.

At its core, health communication is about more than sending messages --- it is about achieving **shared understanding**. Communication is the *process* through which we exchange information, but shared understanding is the *outcome* we seek. To achieve shared understanding, we must **know ourselves** and **know others** so that we can send and receive health messages effectively. This guide is designed to help you do both: by examining your own mindsets, beliefs, and orientations, you develop the self-awareness needed to connect with diverse audiences and craft messages that truly resonate.

## Course Structure

The course consists of five components that build on each other throughout the semester:

Each week follows a consistent rhythm: you begin with the [**reading**]{style="color: #808080;"} to build foundational knowledge, then complete a [**psychographic self-assessment**]{style="color: #c0576e;"} that connects course concepts to your own beliefs and orientations. [**Monday lectures**]{style="color: #c8a62c;"} introduce health communication theory, [**Wednesday case studies**]{style="color: #4a8c50;"} apply those ideas through real-world examples and hands-on activities, and [**campaign worksheets**]{style="color: #d48a29;"} guide you in building a semester-long health communication campaign from concept to completion. This structure ensures that you are not just learning *about* health communication --- you are actively *doing* it.

## Psychographics and Self-Awareness

A central feature of this course is the emphasis on **psychographics** --- the psychological beliefs, values, motivations, and orientations that shape how people receive, interpret, and respond to health messages. Unlike demographics (age, gender, income), psychographics capture *why* people think and behave the way they do. In health communication, understanding your audience's psychographic profile is essential for designing messages that resonate.

At the start of the semester, you completed a comprehensive **Anonymous Beliefs Survey** measuring key psychographic constructs. This guide presents your individual scores alongside the class distribution so you can reflect on who you are as a health communicator. Effective health communicators are aware of their own knowledge, beliefs, skills, identities, and biases (Eurich, 2017). By examining your own psychographic profile, you will develop the meta-cognitive awareness needed to:

- **Understand** how your motivational orientation, moral foundations, cultural values, health beliefs, and social locations influence your receptivity to health messages
- **Recognize** how your beliefs differ from --- or align with --- those of your peers and the broader public
- **Apply** self-knowledge to design more effective, audience-centered health communication campaigns

The next chapter explains how this guide is organized and how to find and interpret your scores.
