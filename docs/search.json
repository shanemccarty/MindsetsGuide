    "text": "About the Course\nWhere did you get that information? Can I trust them? How do I know they’re not lying to me? We navigate questions like these every day — when reading the news, scrolling social media, or deciding whether to follow a doctor’s advice. PH 322 — Communicating Health Information in the Digital Age explores these real-world challenges by introducing the theories, strategies, and tools used to design and evaluate health messages across media platforms. Through hands-on projects and critical analysis, you will learn how to create messages that are accurate, persuasive, culturally relevant, and ethically grounded — while also learning how to recognize misinformation and manipulation.\nAt its core, health communication is about more than sending messages — it is about achieving shared understanding. Communication is the process through which we exchange information, but shared understanding is the outcome we seek. To achieve shared understanding, we must know ourselves and know others so that we can send and receive health messages effectively. This guide is designed to help you do both: by examining your own mindsets, beliefs, and orientations, you develop the self-awareness needed to connect with diverse audiences and craft messages that truly resonate.",

    "text": "Psychographics and Self-Awareness\nA central feature of this course is the emphasis on psychographics — the psychological beliefs, values, motivations, and orientations that shape how people receive, interpret, and respond to health messages. Unlike demographics (age, gender, income), psychographics capture why people think and behave the way they do. In health communication, understanding your audience’s psychographic profile is essential for designing messages that resonate.\nAt the start of the semester, you completed a comprehensive Anonymous Beliefs Survey measuring key psychographic constructs. This guide presents your individual scores alongside the class distribution so you can reflect on who you are as a health communicator. Effective health communicators are aware of their own knowledge, beliefs, skills, identities, and biases (Eurich, 2017). By examining your own psychographic profile, you will develop the meta-cognitive awareness needed to:\n\nUnderstand how your motivational orientation, moral foundations, cultural values, health beliefs, and social locations influence your receptivity to health messages\nRecognize how your beliefs differ from — or align with — those of your peers and the broader public\nApply self-knowledge to design more effective, audience-centered health communication campaigns\n\nThe next chapter explains how this guide is organized and how to find and interpret your scores.",

Understanding your own thinking preferences is the first step toward becoming an effective health communicator, because it helps you recognize your natural strengths, your blind spots, and how to connect with audiences who think differently than you do.\nResearch on cognitive styles and thinking preferences suggests that people tend to favor one or more of four broad thinking orientations. These are not rigid categories — most people use all four at different times — but each of us has natural tendencies that shape how we approach tasks, process information, and communicate with others.",

In health communication, analytical thinkers tend to focus on the strength of the evidence base, the precision of statistical claims, and the logical structure of an argument.\nStrengths in health communication: Evaluating research quality, identifying logical fallacies in health claims, crafting evidence-based messages\n\n\n2.1.2 Structural Thinking\nPeople who favor structural thinking prefer organization, planning, and reliability. They value clear processes, step-by-step approaches, and attention to detail. In health communication, structural thinkers excel at campaign planning, implementation timelines, and ensuring messages are consistent and well-organized.\nStrengths in health communication: Developing systematic campaign plans, creating consistent messaging frameworks, managing project timelines and deliverables\n\n\n2.1.3 Social Thinking\nPeople who favor social thinking are attuned to emotions, relationships, and interpersonal dynamics. They naturally consider how people feel, how groups interact, and how messages affect individuals. In health communication, social thinkers are often skilled at understanding audience needs, building trust, and crafting messages that resonate emotionally.\nStrengths in health communication: Understanding audience perspectives, building community engagement, designing empathetic and culturally sensitive messages\n\n\n2.1.4 Conceptual Thinking\nPeople who favor conceptual thinking are drawn to big-picture ideas, innovation, and creative possibilities. They enjoy brainstorming, imagining new approaches, and thinking about how things could be different. In health communication, conceptual thinkers often generate novel campaign ideas, identify unexpected connections, and push creative boundaries.\nStrengths in health communication: Generating creative campaign concepts, identifying innovative channels and formats, connecting health topics to broader cultural narratives",

Learn more at Herrmann Global.\nEmergenetics: Developed by Geil Browning, this profile measures thinking preferences alongside behavioral attributes. Learn more at Emergenetics.\n\nBoth frameworks highlight that people differ in how they naturally approach thinking, and that awareness of these differences is key to effective communication and teamwork.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteReflect on Your Thinking Preferences\n\n\n\nAs you move through the rest of this guide, consider which thinking preference you rely on most when interpreting your scores.

Each foundation is scored from 2 relevance items and 2 agreement items (after rescaling). Item 6 in each block is a catch/attention-check item and is excluded from scoring.\nExample items:\n\nHarm/Care (Relevance): “Whether or not someone suffered emotionally”\nHarm/Care (Agreement):

Higher scores indicate stronger attribution to that category.\nExample items:\n\nSocial: “Social injustice or discrimination”\nBiological: “Genes or heredity”\nPersonal: “Lack of will or self-control”\nLifestyle: “Improper diet”\n\n\n\nYour Scores\n\n\n\nBeliefs about Causes of Mental Illness: Social & Biological Attributions\n\n\nPassword\nSocial\nSocial (%)\nBiological\nBiological (%)\n\n\n\n\n$iorrZZ2425!\n6.2\n74% (high)\n4.67\n36% (mid)\n\n\n'@Auliebear224757328el\n5.8\n54% (mid)\n2.33\n3% (low)\n\n\n5121lyster\n3.6\n0% (low)\n3.33\n8% (low)\n\n\n78fArO50r\n4.0\n3% (low)\n1.67\n0% (low)\n\n\nArlingtonfootball(333)\n5.4\n33% (low)\n4.67\n36% (mid)\n\n\nBenny2013\n5.6\n46% (mid)\n5.67\n74% (high)\n\n\nBinghamton1234\n6.2\n74% (high)\n4.67\n36% (mid)\n\n\nBirth2005\n7.0\n97% (high)\n7.00\n95% (high)\n\n\nBiscuit1227\n5.8\n54% (mid)\n5.33\n62% (mid)\n\n\nBxqc3216\n6.0\n67% (high)\n5.33\n62% (mid)\n\n\nDamilola1976\n6.4\n79% (high)\n6.00\n82% (high)\n\n\nDecember1912\n5.6\n46% (mid)\n6.33\n90% (high)\n\n\nEski3754\n6.8\n92% (high)\n5.33\n62% (mid)\n\n\nFunkita732\n5.0\n18% (low)\n4.67\n36% (mid)\n\n\nGoodwin7292()!\n5.8\n54% (mid)\n4.67\n36% (mid)\n\n\nHealth$402\n5.4\n33% (low)\n3.67\n13% (low)\n\n\nHealth1203\n5.8\n54% (mid)\n5.33\n62% (mid)\n\n\nLittlekitty1019\n5.0\n18% (low)\n4.00\n23% (low)\n\n\nLongSurvey1234\n6.0\n67% (high)\n6.33\n90% (high)\n\n\nPower2\n4.4\n10% (low)\n4.67\n36% (mid)\n\n\nRcool1229\n5.4\n33% (low)\n7.00\n95% (high)\n\n\nStrawberryhamburger3\n5.2\n28% (low)\n4.33\n28% (low)\n\n\nTinawatsonqwe1\n4.0\n3% (low)\n4.00\n23% (low)\n\n\nVT1107lyn!Bing\n5.6\n46% (mid)\n6.00\n82% (high)\n\n\nbiotinISneeded2313!\n6.4\n79% (high)\n5.33\n62% (mid)\n\n\nbrita6767\n4.2\n8% (low)\n3.00\n5% (low)\n\n\nearth5567\n6.0\n67% (high)\n6.00\n82% (high)\n\n\nha1rcut\n5.8\n54% (mid)\n4.33\n28% (low)\n\n\nhealth0925\n5.0\n18% (low)\n4.67\n36% (mid)\n\n\nhealth1244\n4.8\n13% (low)\n4.67\n36% (mid)\n\n\nhealth1248\n5.4\n33% (low)\n3.67\n13% (low)\n\n\nhealth4103\n6.6\n85% (high)\n3.67\n13% (low)\n\n\njelly1909\n4.8\n13% (low)\n4.33\n28% (low)\n\n\nkyunkyun3890\n6.8\n92% (high)\n5.67\n74% (high)\n\n\nschre0000\n5.2\n28% (low)\n3.33\n8% (low)\n\n\nsurv1901\n5.0\n18% (low)\n5.00\n59% (mid)\n\n\nvidyaravi1\n5.4\n33% (low)\n3.67\n13% (low)\n\n\nwater6331\n6.6\n85% (high)\n7.00\n95% (high)\n\n\nwater9813\n6.6\n85% (high)\n4.67\n36% (mid)\n\n\nwitch2026\n7.0\n97% (high)\n5.67\n74% (high)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeliefs about Causes of Mental Illness: Personal & Lifestyle Attributions\n\n\nPassword\nPersonal\nPersonal (%)\nLifestyle\nLifestyle (%)\n\n\n\n\n$iorrZZ2425!\n5.33\n79% (high)\n5.00\n69% (high)\n\n\n'@Auliebear224757328el\n3.00\n15% (low)\n4.00\n38% (mid)\n\n\n5121lyster\n3.00\n15% (low)\n2.67\n10% (low)\n\n\n78fArO50r\n4.33\n49% (mid)\n2.33\n3% (low)\n\n\nArlingtonfootball(333)\n2.33\n8% (low)\n3.67\n28% (low)\n\n\nBenny2013\n5.67\n87% (high)\n5.50\n92% (high)\n\n\nBinghamton1234\n5.00\n69% (high)\n4.00\n38% (mid)\n\n\nBirth2005\n7.00\n97% (high)\n7.00\n97% (high)\n\n\nBiscuit1227\n6.33\n90% (high)\n5.00\n69% (high)\n\n\nBxqc3216\n3.33\n28% (low)\n4.00\n38% (mid)\n\n\nDamilola1976\n7.00\n97% (high)\n7.00\n97% (high)\n\n\nDecember1912\n2.33\n8% (low)\n5.00\n69% (high)\n\n\nEski3754\n3.00\n15% (low)\n2.67\n10% (low)\n\n\nFunkita732\n4.67\n56% (mid)\n4.67\n62% (mid)\n\n\nGoodwin7292()!\n5.00\n69% (high)\n5.00\n69% (high)\n\n\nHealth$402\n3.33\n28% (low)\n4.33\n56% (mid)\n\n\nHealth1203\n6.33\n90% (high)\n2.67\n10% (low)\n\n\nLittlekitty1019\n5.33\n79% (high)\n3.67\n28% (low)\n\n\nLongSurvey1234\n4.67\n56% (mid)\n3.00\n18% (low)\n\n\nPower2\n3.00\n15% (low)\n4.33\n56% (mid)\n\n\nRcool1229\n4.33\n49% (mid)\n2.33\n3% (low)\n\n\nStrawberryhamburger3\n2.00\n5% (low)\n1.67\n0% (low)\n\n\nTinawatsonqwe1\n4.00\n41% (mid)\n4.00\n38% (mid)\n\n\nVT1107lyn!Bing\n3.33\n28% (low)\n4.00\n38% (mid)\n\n\nbiotinISneeded2313!\n4.33\n49% (mid)\n4.67\n62% (mid)\n\n\nbrita6767\n4.00\n41% (mid)\n4.00\n38% (mid)\n\n\nearth5567\n5.00\n69% (high)\n6.00\n95% (high)\n\n\nha1rcut\n4.00\n41% (mid)\n4.67\n62% (mid)\n\n\nhealth0925\n3.67\n36% (mid)\n4.00\n38% (mid)\n\n\nhealth1244\n1.67\n0% (low)\n3.33\n21% (low)\n\n\nhealth1248\n4.67\n56% (mid)\n5.33\n85% (high)\n\n\nhealth4103\n6.67\n95% (high)\n3.33\n21% (low)\n\n\njelly1909\n3.67\n36% (mid)\n3.67\n28% (low)\n\n\nkyunkyun3890\n4.67\n56% (mid)\n5.33\n85% (high)\n\n\nschre0000\n4.67\n56% (mid)\n3.33\n21% (low)\n\n\nsurv1901\n5.00\n69% (high)\n5.00\n69% (high)\n\n\nvidyaravi1\n3.00\n15% (low)\n2.33\n3% (low)\n\n\nwater6331\n1.67\n0% (low)\n5.00\n69% (high)\n\n\nwater9813\n5.33\n79% (high)\n5.33\n85% (high)\n\n\nwitch2026\n2.67\n13% (low)\n3.67\n28% (low)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nBeliefs about the Causes of Mental Illness: Social & Biological attributions.

As health communicators, understanding your own relationship with social media — including potential problematic use — is essential for designing effective campaigns on digital platforms. Your health behaviors provide context for how lifestyle factors intersect with communication patterns.\nSocial media use is a critical consideration for health communicators. This section pairs two complementary measures: Social Media Addiction, which captures problematic patterns of social media engagement, and Social Media Hours, which quantifies the raw time spent on platforms each day. Together, these indicators reveal both the quantity and quality of your social media relationship.",
